## Building Real-Time Data Streaming using Kafka, Apache Flink and Postgres

### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time data streaming pipeline using Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and PostgreSQL. The pipeline will ingest data from various sources, process it in real-time using Flink, and store the processed data in a PostgreSQL database.

### Project Goals
Ingest data from various sources in real-time.
Process data using Flink for tasks like filtering, aggregation, and transformation.
Store processed data in a PostgreSQL database for further analysis.
Ensure scalability and fault tolerance of the pipeline.
Provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring and management.

**Technology Stack
Apache Kafka: A distributed streaming platform for publishing and subscribing to streams of records. It will act as the backbone of the pipeline.
Apache Flink: A distributed stream processing framework for processing real-time data streams. It will be used for data processing tasks.
PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It will store the processed data.
Docker Desktop: A convenient tool for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
